# Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) for .NET, Windows Store, Windows Phone 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 Silverlight

Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) provides easy to use authentication functionality for your .NET client and Windows Store apps by taking advantage of Windows Server Active Directory and Windows Azure Active Directory.
Here you can find the source code for the library. You can find the corresponding releases (both stable and prerelease) on the NuGet gallery at [http://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory/](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory/).

- The latest stable release is [2.18.206251556](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory/). 
- 
- The next version of the library in prerelease form is also available on the NuGet gallery.

## Samples and Documentation

[We provide a full suite of sample applications and documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/AzureADSamples) to help you get started with learning the Azure Identity system. This includes tutorials for native clients such as Windows, Windows Phone, iOS, OSX, Android, and Linux. We also provide full walkthroughs for authentication flows such as OAuth2, OpenID Connect, Graph API, and other awesome features. 

## Diagnostics

The following are the primary sources of information for diagnosing issues:

+ Exceptions
+ Logs
+ Network traces

Also, note that correlation IDs are central to the diagnostics in the library.  You can set your correlation IDs on a per request basis (by setting `CorrelationId` property on `AuthenticationContext` before calling an acquire token method) if you want to correlate an ADAL request with other operations in your code. If you don't set a correlations id, then ADAL will generate a random one which changes on each request. All log messages and network calls will be stamped with the correlation id.  

### Exceptions

This is obviously the first diagnostic.  We try to provide helpful error messages.  If you find one that is not helpful please file an [issue](https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-dotnet/issues) and let us know. Please also provide the target platform of your application (e.g. Desktop, Windows Store, Windows Phone).

### Logs

You can configure the library to generate log messages that you can use to help diagnose issues.  You configure logging by setting properties of the static class `AdalTrace`; however, depending on the platform, logging methods and the properties of this class differ. Here is how logging works on each platform:

#### Desktop Applications

ADAL.NET for desktop applications by default logs via `System.Diagnostics.Trace` class. You can add a trace listener to receive those logs. You can also control tracing using this method (e.g. change trace level or turn it off) using `AdalTrace.LegacyTraceSwitch`. 

The following example shows how to add a Console based listener and set trace level to `Information` (the default trace level is `Verbose`):

```
Trace.Listeners.Add(new ConsoleTraceListener());
AdalTrace.LegacyTraceSwitch.Level = TraceLevel.Info;
```

You can achieve the same result by adding the following lines to your application's config file:

```
  <system.diagnostics>
    <sharedListeners>
      <add name="console" 
        type="System.Diagnostics.ConsoleTraceListener" 
        initializeData="false"/>
    </sharedListeners>
    <trace autoflush="true">
      <listeners>
        <add name="console" />
      </listeners>
    </trace>    
    <switches>
      <add name="ADALLegacySwitch" value="Info"/>
    </switches>
  </system.diagnostics>
```

If you would like to have more control over how tracing is done in ADAL, you can add a `TraceListener` to ADAL's dedicated `TraceSource` with name **"Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory"**. 

The following example shows how to write ADAL's traces to a text file using this method:

```
Stream logFile = File.Create("logFile.txt");
AdalTrace.TraceSource.Listeners.Add(new TextWriterTraceListener(logFile));
AdalTrace.TraceSource.Switch.Level = SourceLevels.Information;
```

You can achieve the same result by adding the following lines to your application's config file:

```
  <system.diagnostics>
    <trace autoflush="true"/>
    <sources>
      <source name="Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory" 
        switchName="sourceSwitch" 
        switchType="System.Diagnostics.SourceSwitch">
        <listeners>
          <add name="textListener" 
            type="System.Diagnostics.TextWriterTraceListener" 
            initializeData="logFile.txt"/>
          <remove name="Default" />
        </listeners>
      </source>
    </sources>    
    <switches>
      <add name="sourceSwitch" value="Information"/>
    </switches>
  </system.diagnostics>
``` 

#### Windows Store and Windows Phone Applications

Tracing in ADAL for Windows Store and Windows Phone is done via an instance of class `System.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource` with name **"Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory"**. You can define your own ```EventListener```, connect it to the event source and set your desired trace level. Here is an example:
```
var eventListener = new SampleEventListener();

class SampleEventListener : EventListener
{
    protected override void OnEventSourceCreated(EventSource eventSource)
    {
        if (eventSource.Name == "Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory")
        {
            this.EnableEvents(eventSource, EventLevel.Verbose);
        }
    }

    protected override void OnEventWritten(EventWrittenEventArgs eventData)
    {
	    ...
    }
}

```

There is also a default event listener which writes logs to a local file named **"AdalTraces.log"**. You can control the level of tracing to that event listener using the property ```AdalTrace.Level```. By default, trace level for this event listener is set to "None" and to enable tracing to this particular listener, you need to set the above property. This is an example:

```
AdalTrace.Level = AdalTraceLevel.Informational;
```

#### Windows Phone Silverlight Applications

Since Silverlight does not support EventSource/EventListener, we use ```LoggingChannel/LoginSession``` for logging. There is a ```LoggingChannel``` in ```AdalTrace``` which you can connect your own ```LoggingSession/FileLoggingSession``` to it and also control trace level using it. Here is an example:

```
LoggingSession loggingSession = new LoggingSession("ADAL Logging Session");
loggingSession.AddLoggingChannel(AdalTrace.AdalLoggingChannel, LoggingLevel.Verbose);
```

and then use ```loggingSession.SaveToFileAsync(...)``` to copy the logs to a file. If you use emulator, you can then use ```ISETool.exe``` and ```tracerpt.exe``` tools to copy log file and convert it to text format.

### Network Traces

You can use various tools to capture the HTTP traffic that ADAL generates.  This is most useful if you are familiar with the OAuth protocol or if you need to provide diagnostic information to Microsoft or other support channels.

Fiddler is the easiest HTTP tracing tool.  In order to be useful it is necessary to configure fiddler to record unencrypted SSL traffic.  

NOTE: Traces generated in this way may contain highly privileged information such as access tokens, usernames and passwords.  If you are using production accounts, do not share these traces with 3rd parties.  If you need to supply a trace to someone in order to get support, reproduce the issue with a temporary account with usernames and passwords that you don't mind sharing.

## Community Help and Support

## How to Run Tests

The majority of tests in this repo are mstests which run either as unit tests (with TestCategory 'AdalDotNetUnit' or 'AdalWinRTUnit') or as end to end test running against a mock service (with TestCategory 'AdalDotNetMock' or 'AdalWinRTMock'). 
These tests are self contained and can run either using Test Explorer in Visual Studio or command line tool mstest.exe.

To run the rest of the tests, you need to create an account on Azure Active Directory (AAD) and/or setup your own ADFS server and then configure them with configurations in file STS.cs.
